      “My music is like my hair in a lot of ways.  Dirty. Textured.  Flowy.  I never really know which way it’s going but at least it keeps growing.” - sleepy the creator
    </p>
    <p>
      Influenced by halftime drum and bass, hip hop, downtempo, and dark dubstep, like a modern day Thriftworks, his music is experimental and vibey.  Sleepy’s music provides layers of danceable grooves, while being abstract and thoughtful, typically played in the dark. While also having a chill side intended to break up the rave with high quality sunrise music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Primarily based in British Columbia, and heavily influenced by West Coast music, he’s had the opportunity to live, create, and host shows across Canada.  Inspired by a wide range of art, sound, psychedelics, and nature.  Making music for Sleepy is about turning off the world, and tuning into something magical.

    “I entered a creative flow state a few years ago, and I don’t know if it’s ever going to end.  Now, I have all these ideas and sounds that I'm really excited to share with friends and whoever wants to be involved” - sleepy
